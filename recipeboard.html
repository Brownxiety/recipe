        <p>
        1. We start by frying the chicken in a generous amount of oil. We can't really get away from the oil here, soz.<br>
        2.We than add in a LOT of minced ginger and garlic. Please, none of that pre-made, jarred stuff. FRESH ginger and garlic is KEY here. Remember I said Karahis have a huge emphasis on fragrance and natural flavours? These two ingredients are a MAJOR component of that and nothing does it like fresh does. We want to fry these just enough for the raw smell to go away - under no circumstances should you allow this to burn because it will taint the flavour of the Karahi.<br>
        3. We then go ahead and add all our tomatoes and spices. The tomatoes will release TONS of moisture and will break down into a beautifully jammy, thick gravy that will coat the chicken.<br>
        4. We allow this mix to cook on high, stirring as needed to make sure it doesn't catch at the bottom of the pan. We don't put the lid on because we are concentrating and thickening the sauce. If we put the lid on, we won't get that true Karahi look or flavour because we will be containing the moisture in our pan. The result will be a boiled/steamed chicken that looks more like a red chicken shorba. Not ideal for a Karahi!<br>
        5. At about the 15-20 minute mark, the gravy will have thickened nicely, the oil will be separating around the edges, the chicken will be cooked and things will be looking almost done. At this point, you can add the chopped coriander and chillis, turn the heat to low and allow everything to simmer together again without the lid. It can simmer for 5 minutes at this point.<br>
        6. It's all ready! Now you can garnish with your slices of ginger and serve as you please. <br>

            1. <b>Prepare the chicken curry</b>. Prepare the biryani masala (or use store-bought) and marinate the chicken. Start the chicken curry. While the chicken cooks over low heat, make the rice. <br>
            2.<b>Prepare the rice</b>Bring a pot of water to a boil and parboil the rice. Drain and set aside.<br>
            3. <b>Bring it all together for a final steam (‘dum‘).</b>Layer half of the rice, all of the chicken, and then the remaining rice on top. Add the finishing touches. Allow steam to develop, then lower the heat and let the flavors meld.<br>
